# Insurance Management Platform

### An management system which uses CURD operation 

First step before running the code

```
  run pom.xml
```

This allows for downloading of all the dependencies which is required to run the project

All the classes such as client , policies , claim are present in 
```
src/main/java.com.example.demo
```
Once opened run the foloowing class
```
DemoApplication.java
```
This verfies all the dependecies and boots up the embedded database along with the springboot

The link for getting into the web terminal is as follows:
# Client
```
http://localhost:8080/api/clients
```

# Policies
```
http://localhost:8080/api/policies
```
# Claim
```
http://localhost:8080/api/claims
```
We use postman_collection to use  POST or GET function and also many other function  

Through this we can communicate with the controllers and repositories classes

use the JSON as an example saved in demo postman_collection to push it to the 

Embeeded service system ( USE Postman service in VSC or download the Postman GUI )
